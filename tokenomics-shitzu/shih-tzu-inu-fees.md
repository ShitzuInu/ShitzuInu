# üê∂ Shitzu Inu fees

## :clap:2% on buys and 2% on sells.

## Purchase Fees

This is 2% for **marketing** development, where our team will invest in outreach, prioritizing influencers and groups with large communities.

## Sales Fees

Sales fees will be divided into two sectors:

**Liquidity** - 1% will be reversed to maintain the liquidity of the project&#x20;

**Burn** - 1% will be burned in order to promote scarcity in the token, thus making it more and more valuable.
